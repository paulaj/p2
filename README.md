# P2: Generate Password!

## Live URL
http://p2-pjacobs.gopagoda.com/
(Everything works better on local server. Pagoda box is just slow. )

## Description
A password generator inspired by the xkcd comic: http://xkcd.com/936/
The inputs are pretty self explanatory. I used an image of the comic rather than a description.

## Details for teaching team
No login required, but useful for sites where it is :)

## Outside code
* Bootstrap was used to make my pretty ui
*Jquery was used for selectors so I could disable a textbox when a checkbox was not checked
*Word lists! I only used three, but that's still a lot of words!
